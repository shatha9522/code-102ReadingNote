It can be helpful to ask some
questions about the people you
would expect to be interested in
the subject of your site.
If you ask a client who a site is
for, it is not uncommon for them
to answer "the entire world."
Realistically, it is unlikely to be
relevant to everyone. If your site
sells light bulbs, even though
most people using a computer
probably use light bulbs, they
are not likely to order them from
someone in a different country.

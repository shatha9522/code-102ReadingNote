A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.

Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.

Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.

To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 

## expression
 evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 

 ### EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE

 var color = 'beige';

### EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN ASINGLE VALUE

var area = 3 * 2; 

A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.

Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value. 

Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.

Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).

Expressions evaluate into a single value.

Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

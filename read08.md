## Loop Operator
The Loop operator loops an enclosed sequence of operators in a process either a specified number of times or indefinitely. You can place it in a process and can resize the box to accommodate any number of operators in the sequence.

# For Loop
A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array. In this example, the scores for each round of a test are stored in an array called scores. 


# While Loop
Here is an example of awhil e loop. It writes out the 5 times table. Each time the loop is run, another calculation is written into the variable called msg. This loop will continue to run for as long as the condition in the parentheses is true. That condition is a counter indicating that, as long as the variable i remains less than 10, the statements in the subsequent code block should run.

## CSS
 is the language we use to style an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

## CSS stand for Cascading Style Sheet- CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contentsof that box) is presented.

## CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.


# Type of adding style to a HTML code :

Inline style <p style ="properties : value">

Internal style adding style inside HTML File selector { preparties :value}

 ## Color names 
  Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number. MediumAquaMarine There are 147 color names supported by browsers (this color is MediumAquaMarine). Most consider this to be a limited color palette, and it is hard to remember the name for each of the colors so (apart from white and black) they are not commonly used.

 ### Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue.

  ### To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

  ### It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
